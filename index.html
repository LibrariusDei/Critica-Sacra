		Critica Sacra Veteris Novique Testamenti

		<h2>What is this place?</h2>
		<p>
			It's a first stab at a website generally centered around the critical study of the Old and New Testament! (I mean, you saw the title, right?)
		</p>
		<h2>Ok, but... why is it so empty?</h2>
		<p>
			Uhh... because I haven't really planned this out yet. But I had to start with something, right?
		</p>
		<h2>Who are you, anyway?</h2>
		<p>
			Oh, right. My name is Jonathan Wilken. I'm a final-year PhD student studying the ways scribes made mistakes when copying manuscripts.
		</p>
		<h2>Why are you doing this?!</h2>
		<p>
			I just thought it would be a good idea to have a website! Calm down! I'll make it better later!
